Added inital latex outline for replica paper.
I expanded the scope of the paper a bit.
There is a lot of discussion on replica mechanisms for p2p networks.
Almost all of it focuses on churn robustness rather than partition tolerance.
Work looks like it should be focused on examing how exemplars of these schemes work in terms of partition tolerance.
